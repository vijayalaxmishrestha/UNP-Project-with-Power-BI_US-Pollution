# UNP-Project-with-Power-BI_US-Pollution

During my capstone project 1 with Power BI during my internship at the United Network of Professionals (UNP), I:
 1. The dataset provides concise data on air quality monitoring in the United States. It covers pollutants like NO2, O3, SO2, and CO, offering measurements such as mean concentrations, maximum values, and AQI for each pollutant across various locations. This dataset facilitates analysis of air quality trends and their regional impacts.
 2. I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates, ensuring data accuracy. Managed data types and date/time values for consistency. Merged tables and used Power Query Editor for systematic data preparation steps.
 3. KPIs:1. Calculated average AQI (NO2, CO, O3, SO2) by State and Time using DAX functions (AVERAGEX, GROUPBY). Determined maximum AQI (NO2, CO, O3, SO2) by Time using DAX MAX function.
4. Metrics:Calculated average and maximum AQI values (NO2, CO, O3, SO2) using appropriate DAX measures (AVERAGE, MAX).
5.In the dashboard:
- Implemented date, city, and state slicers for dynamic filtering.
- Created a stacked bar chart displaying Average CO, NO2, O3, and SO2 AQI by State.
- Applied Trends and Forecast analysis for 5-year pollutant trends.
- Analyzed peak pollution trends over the years for each pollutant, offering comprehensive insights into air quality patterns and trends.
6)Greatly supported in the development of user-friendly interfaces and data visualization.
