1)Took the lead in creating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), implementing data transformations, conducting calculations, and calculating metrics using DAX to guarantee accurate data analysis and reporting.
2)Greatly supported in the development of user-friendly interfaces and data visualization.
3)Using the US Pollution dataset, I examined the Air Quality Index (AQI) for various pollutants, including NO2, CO, O3, and SO2.
